<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 11, 2026</p>

<p>Welcome to <strong>FilmGuess.com</strong>. FilmGuess is an interactive entertainment platform that presents short, transformed, and editorially modified audio excerpts derived from motion pictures within a quiz-based game format. This Privacy Policy explains in detail how we collect, process, store, use, disclose, and protect personal information when you access or use our website and related services (collectively, the “Service”).</p>

<p>By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms. If you do not agree, you must discontinue use of the Service.</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Scope of This Policy</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users of FilmGuess worldwide. It governs information collected directly from users, automatically through technology, and through third-party integrations necessary for the operation of the Service.</p>

<p>This Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services that may be linked from FilmGuess. We encourage users to review the privacy policies of those external services.</p>

<hr />

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We collect information necessary to operate, maintain, improve, and protect the Service. The categories of information collected depend on how you interact with FilmGuess.</p>

<h3>Account and Registration Information</h3>

<p>When you create an account, we may collect identifying and account-related information such as your name, username, email address, encrypted password credentials, and selected profile preferences. Passwords are stored using industry-standard cryptographic hashing methods and are not accessible in plain text.</p>

<h3>Gameplay and Interaction Data</h3>

<p>Because FilmGuess is an interactive quiz-based entertainment platform, we collect gameplay-related data, including scores, guesses submitted, completion times, leaderboard rankings, session frequency, performance statistics, and feature usage. This information enables us to deliver core gameplay functionality, ensure fairness, detect abuse, and enhance user engagement.</p>

<h3>Communications and Support</h3>

<p>If you contact us for support, feedback, contest participation, promotional inquiries, or copyright concerns, we may collect the information you voluntarily provide, including your email address and message content. We retain this information for customer service, dispute resolution, and compliance purposes.</p>

<h3>Sensitive Personal Information</h3>

<p>FilmGuess does not request, require, or intentionally collect sensitive personal information such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, biometric identifiers, health information, sexual orientation, or criminal history. If such information is voluntarily submitted, it will be handled solely for the purpose for which it was provided and in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<hr />

<h2>3. Information Collected Automatically</h2>

<p>When you access the Service, certain technical and usage data may be collected automatically through cookies, analytics technologies, server logs, and similar tracking tools. This information may include IP address, browser type and version, operating system, device characteristics, referring URLs, session duration, interaction metrics, and unique device identifiers.</p>

<p>This data enables us to maintain system integrity, detect unauthorized access, analyze performance trends, prevent fraud or automated scraping, and improve overall user experience. We may use aggregated or anonymized data for analytics and product development.</p>

<hr />

<h2>4. Nature of the Service and Editorial Transformation of Audio Content</h2>

<p>FilmGuess presents short, editorially modified audio excerpts derived from motion pictures for the sole purpose of interactive quiz gameplay and entertainment. These excerpts are not presented as substitutes for original films and are not intended to reproduce or distribute full-length copyrighted works.</p>

<p>Each audio segment is intentionally limited in duration and context. In many cases, excerpts are edited, altered, or re-contextualized to serve a distinct interactive function within the game environment. The value provided by FilmGuess lies not in the underlying motion picture audio itself, but in the curated selection, transformation, editorial sequencing, interactive mechanics, scoring systems, competitive structure, and user engagement framework developed independently by FilmGuess.</p>

<p>FilmGuess does not stream complete films, provide downloadable audio tracks, or offer full-length reproductions of copyrighted works. The Service is designed as a transformative, quiz-based entertainment experience that integrates audio fragments into a broader original game architecture.</p>

<p>FilmGuess respects the intellectual property rights of content owners and does not claim ownership over underlying motion pictures or their original sound recordings. All rights in original works remain with their respective copyright holders.</p>

<hr />

<h2>5. Legal Position Regarding Content Presentation</h2>

<p>The Service is structured around editorial transformation and interactive implementation. The protected creative contribution of FilmGuess consists of the compilation methodology, selection process, editing approach, technological implementation, interface design, gameplay logic, scoring mechanics, and overall interactive structure. These elements constitute original creative expression owned by FilmGuess.</p>

<p>Nothing in this Policy should be interpreted as a transfer, assignment, or assertion of ownership over third-party copyrighted motion pictures. FilmGuess operates with respect for intellectual property laws and responds promptly to valid infringement notices submitted in accordance with applicable legal frameworks.</p>

<hr />

<h2>6. How We Use Personal Information</h2>

<p>We process personal information on lawful bases including contractual necessity, legitimate interest, user consent where applicable, and compliance with legal obligations.</p>

<p>Personal information may be used to create and manage user accounts, deliver gameplay functionality, maintain leaderboards, prevent fraud or misuse, enforce our Terms of Use, communicate important service updates, provide customer support, and improve product performance.</p>

<p>We may also use anonymized or aggregated data for analytics, business planning, and product development purposes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>7. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>

<p>We may share personal information with trusted service providers who assist in hosting, infrastructure, analytics, payment processing, security monitoring, customer support, and operational services. These providers are contractually obligated to process data solely on our instructions and to implement appropriate security safeguards.</p>

<p>We may disclose information where required by law, regulation, subpoena, court order, or governmental request, or when necessary to protect our legal rights, enforce contractual agreements, prevent fraud, or protect user safety.</p>

<p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or asset sale, user information may be transferred as part of the transaction, subject to confidentiality obligations.</p>

<hr />

<h2>8. Payment Processing</h2>

<p>If the Service offers paid features, payments are processed by third-party payment processors. FilmGuess does not store complete payment card numbers. Payment data is handled directly by certified payment providers in accordance with applicable financial security standards.</p>

<hr />

<h2>9. Data Security</h2>

<p>We implement commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect personal information against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no system can guarantee absolute security, and users acknowledge that internet-based services carry inherent risk.</p>

<hr />

<h2>10. Data Retention</h2>

<p>We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our legitimate business interests. When data is no longer required, it is securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

<hr />

<h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>FilmGuess is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required by applicable law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware of such collection, we will take appropriate steps to delete the information.</p>

<hr />

<h2>12. Your Rights</h2>

<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including access, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, data portability, or objection to processing. You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the information provided below.</p>

<h2>13. International Data Transfers</h2>

<p>Your information may be processed in jurisdictions outside your country of residence. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that cross-border data transfers comply with applicable legal standards.</p>

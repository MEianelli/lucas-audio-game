      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) – FilmGuess</h1>

      <p>
        FilmGuess was created by passionate movie lovers who believe that iconic film moments deserve to be remembered,
        recognized, and celebrated. Below you’ll find detailed answers about how our movie audio guessing game works,
        why we built it, and what makes it different.
      </p>

      <h2>What is FilmGuess?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>FilmGuess is an interactive movie audio quiz game</strong> where players listen to short, carefully edited
        sound excerpts from well-known motion pictures and select the correct title from four possible answers.
        It combines film trivia, cinematic memory, competitive gameplay, and cultural recognition into one fast and engaging experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project was created in 2026 by a small team of film enthusiasts who grew up quoting lines,
        debating directors, analyzing scenes, and replaying unforgettable moments. FilmGuess transforms that passion into
        a structured, competitive digital game that rewards knowledge, speed, and attention to detail.
      </p>

      <h2>Why was FilmGuess created?</h2>
      <p>
        FilmGuess was born from a simple idea: movie lovers do not just watch films — they remember them.
        They recognize voices, tones, background music, emotional pauses, and even subtle delivery styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        We wanted to create a <strong>movie recognition challenge</strong> that tests real cinematic knowledge.
        Not just titles. Not just actors. But memory, listening skills, and cultural awareness.
        FilmGuess exists to celebrate cinema culture in a playful and competitive format.
      </p>

      <h2>Are the movie clips full-length?</h2>
      <p>
        No. FilmGuess uses <strong>extremely short, editorially modified audio excerpts</strong> integrated into a quiz-based format.
        These clips are intentionally limited in duration and presented solely within the interactive gameplay structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not stream full movies, provide full soundtracks, or offer downloadable content.
        The purpose of the excerpts is recognition and entertainment within a game environment,
        not replacement or distribution of original works.
      </p>

      <h2>Is FilmGuess affiliated with movie studios?</h2>
      <p>
        FilmGuess is an independent entertainment platform created by cinema enthusiasts.
        We are not affiliated with or endorsed by movie studios unless explicitly stated.
      </p>
      <p>
        We respect the intellectual property rights of all copyright holders and present short,
        transformed audio segments strictly within the context of a quiz-based entertainment experience.
      </p>

      <h2>How is FilmGuess different from other movie trivia games?</h2>
      <p>
        Many movie trivia platforms focus on text-based questions.
        FilmGuess focuses on <strong>audio recognition</strong>.
        You must listen carefully and identify the movie from voice tone, pacing, delivery, and atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge becomes more intense under time pressure.
        That competitive layer transforms passive knowledge into active recall.
        The experience feels dynamic, social, and skill-driven.
      </p>

      <h2>How often is FilmGuess updated?</h2>
      <p>
        We update FilmGuess weekly with new movie audio challenges,
        refreshed rankings, and themed quizzes inspired by genres, decades, or iconic directors.

        This competitive structure motivates continuous improvement
        and rewards consistent cinematic knowledge.

      <h2>Why are only short clips used?</h2>
      <p>
        Short clips make gameplay fast, challenging, and focused.
        The objective is recognition, not replaying entire scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        By limiting duration, we maintain a rapid pace
        that keeps players engaged and encourages replayability.

      </p>
      <p>
        FilmGuess thrives on collective cinema culture.
        If a film left a strong impression on you,
        chances are it belongs in a recognition challenge.
